        Every day a new frog is born weight 0grams and grows at a rate of
        10grams/day, maxing out at 100grams in 10 days
      </h3>
      <h3>On day n, what is the total weight of the frog community?</h3>
      <h4>My Logic:</h4>
      <p>
        If 1 frog is born per day, the relationship between number of frogs to
        number of days is 1:1 therefore assuming we begin with 0 frogs; n_frogs
        == n_days.
      </p>
      <p>
        A frog grows at a rate of 10grams/day starting from 0grams, by this
        logic the first frog on day 1 weighs 0 grams and will not reach its max
        weight until its 11th day. On the 11th day there would be a total of 11
        frogs with the first frog at max weight, and the community's list of
        weights would be like so: <br></br>
        <br></br>
        [0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
      </p>
      <p>
        The fun part starts after the 11th day as the subsequent frogs start to
        max out in weight. Say 15 days have passed we now have 15 frogs and 5 of
        them are fully grown ( 15frogs - 10days = 5 ) and our community looks
        like:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>[0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,100,100,100,100]
      </p>
      <p>
        If we were to separate the community of frogs into 2 distinct groups,
        "juvenile" and "matured", the former being frogs under 100 grams and the
        latter being at max weight, a few things would hold true:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If there are more than 10 frogs there will always be only 10 that are
          juvenile and the matured being the difference
        </li>
        <li>A full set of juvenile frogs will have a total weight of 450</li>
        <li>
          The total weight of matured frogs will be the number of matured * 100
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now if we dust off our old Calc I textbook we could find a formula for
        sigma notation that will take care of finding the sum of all juvenile
        weights{' '}
      </p>
      <div className='equation'>
        <div className='summation'>
          {' '}
          <sup>k</sup> <div>&Sigma;</div> <sub>n=1 </sub>
        </div>
        <span>
          10(n - 1) = k(a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub>)/2
        </span>
      </div>

      <p>
        Where <i>k</i> is the number of days, <i>n</i> is the respective day
        starting from 1, and{' '}
        <i>
          a<sub>n</sub>
        </i>{' '}
        represents the weight of the frog on that day.
      </p>
      <h4>psuedo code</h4>
      <p>
        In order to translate that equation into code we could clean it up a
        bit. Since we know a<sub>1</sub> is always going to be 0 grams we can
        omit it from the equation and rearrange it a bit to produce(using n as
        number of days as originally asked): <br></br>
        <br></br>{' '}
        <code>
          juv_sum = 5n<sup>2</sup> - 5n
        </code>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Now to account for any fully matured frogs we simply multiply their
        weight by their group size:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <code>mat_sum = (n - 10) * 100 </code>
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Instead of some convoluted expression we can just use the two we have
        and create a statement based off of what we know therefore calling
        whichever is necessary
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <code>
          function totalWeight(n):
          <br></br>
          if n is less than or equal to 10: <br></br> return(5n<sup>2</sup> -
          5n)
          <br></br>
          else:
          <br></br>
          return(100n - 550) //this includes the 450 grams of juveniles
        </code>
      </p>
      <h3>On day n, what is the average weight of the average frog?</h3>
      <p>
        In order to calculate the average weight of the frog community we will
        leverage our sum from the previous solution. The average is calculated
        by dividing the sum of all parts by its quantity, <i>n</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefor we could produce a function like so: <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <code>
          function averageWeight(n):<br></br> let sum = totalWeight(n)
          <br></br> return(sum/n)
        </code>
      </p>
      <h3>
        How might we redesign the model to allow for new frogs to be born on a
        manually set schedule?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Since the rate at which the frogs were born, <i>r</i>, had a 1:1 ratio
        it was not incorporated into the original model. Let's first consider
        what we can safely assume:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Once the threshold of 10 days of growth, the frog will not grow
          anymore
        </li>
        <li>
          If the birth rate of frogs is greater than or equal 10 days there will
          never be more than one juvenile at a time
        </li>
        <li>
          If the birthrate spans over multiple days at a time the frogs maturity
          threshold will be later
        </li>
        <li>
          If the frogs are being born at an increased rate, that rate will act
          as a constant in the original equation
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As I had previously mentioned, that Calculus book was a bit dusty so
        while coming up with a new equation that will incorporate any birthrate
        we can use the wizardry of coding
      </p>

      <p>
        To approach this we will consider the rate <i>r</i> in units of
        (frogs/day). As mentioned in our assumptions, if the rate is increased
        and we have multiple frogs per day, we could just multiply the current
        equations that we have set up, this is because the birth and growth rate
        will remain on a daily schedule and the maturity threshold will be
        reached when originally expected just double or triple the company, this
        will not be the case with a slowed rate.
      </p>

      <p>
        First if we figure out when the first frog will grow into its adult
        weight, we could use that day as our new threshold. For example if a
        frog is born every 2 days(r = 1 frog/2 days) and we know that it takes
        10 days to reach maturity, it would be safe to say the first frog that
        is born won't reach maturity until the 12th day. Using that day as a
        marker we will know when we can separate our age groups.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next to determine the number of frogs we will have after <i>n</i> days
        we just multiply <i>n</i> by the birth rate <i>r</i> to get our
        community size let's call it <i>c</i>. So following the rate of 1 frog
        per 2 days, and we want to determine the total weight at n = 15 days,
        first thing we'll get is the community size.{' '}
        <i>c = r*n ~> 0.5 * 15 = 7.5</i> meaning we have 7 frogs who have at
        least lived 1 full day since their birth. Since the first frog won't
        reach maturity until day 12 so we can assess that we have at least 2
        frogs at maturity. Base case, a community with 7 frogs that we know 2
        are mature and 5 are juvenile that looks something like:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>c = [0,20,40,60,80,100,100]<br></br>
        <br></br>
        We can sum up the juveniles by iterating through and reducing their sum
        weight and simply add on the total of matured frogs. Since this is only
        our base case we are not accounting for any days inbetween each birth.
        In order to do so we will take any remaining days using the modulo (%)
        operator and add them on during the iterative process. The final product
        yield:
      </p>
      <p>
        {' '}
        <code>
          function totalWeight(n,r=1):
          <br></br>sum = 0<br></br>
          juv_sum = 0 <br></br> mat_sum = 0 <br></br>
          growth_rate = 10 <br></br>
          community_size = n * r<br></br>
          if n is less than or equal to 10 and r is equal to or greater than 1:{' '}
          <br></br> sum = r * (5n<sup>2</sup> - 5n)<br></br>return sum
          <br></br>
          else if n is greater than 10 and r is equal to or greater than 1:
          <br></br>
          sum = r * (100n - 550)
          <br></br>return sum <br></br>
          else:
          <br></br>
          mat_size = (n - (growth_rate+(1/r)))/(1/r) juv_size = community_size -
          mat_size
          <br></br>for (i = 0; i &lt; juv_size; i++)&#123;<br></br>
          juv_sum += ((i * (growth_rate/r)) + (growth_rate * ( n % 2)))
          <br></br>&#125; mat_sum = mat_size * 100 <br></br> sum = mat_sum +
          juv_sum
          <br></br> return sum
        </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to calculate the average weight, we would not change much of
        the original model except for the fact that it uses the sum function as
        a nested function so we would need to pass the rate through the
        parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to note that this function seems a bit verbose and there
        are indeed cleaner alternative approaches such as using array methods to
        populate, iterate through, and reduce our values. Given the nature of
        the question I decided to go through a more mathematical approach
